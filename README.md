Project Summary
Phish Phingers is a playful and physical party game designed to raise awareness about NFC skimming and digital security risks - but in a way that feels fun, safe, and genuinely approachable. Rather than relying heavily on screen-based learning or lectures, we wanted to create something tactile and engaging that gets people moving, laughing, and learning at the same time.

The concept is inspired by the real-world risk of NFC skimming - when someone secretly uses a scanner to collect data from your contactless card or device. In Phish Phingers, that threat becomes a game mechanic. Players take on the roles of taggers (the “phishers”) or targets (the “phished”), using NFC technology to “tag” others in a fast-paced game of digital cat-and-mouse. While playful, the experience is designed to mirror the subtlety and unpredictability of real-world NFC threats.

Audience and Context
Our audience includes young adults, students, and anyone unfamiliar with the invisible risks of contactless technology. By framing cyber threats in a game format, we aim to make people more curious and informed about everyday digital vulnerabilities - without scaring them off. This prototype was created as part of a university group project with a focus on blending physical computing, interaction design and cybersecurity education.

How to Run / Interact with the Prototype
Install the App:
Open the APK via Android Studio or install the app directly onto an NFC-capable Android device.

Launch the Game Interface:
Once the app is launched, you'll be guided through a simple setup screen where you choose player roles (tagger or target).
