## Project Summary
Phish Phingers is a playful and physical party game designed to raise awareness about NFC skimming and digital security risks - but in a way that feels fun, safe and genuinely approachable. Rather than relying on a screen-based experience, we wanted to create something tactile and engaging that gets people moving, laughing and learning at the same time.

The concept is inspired by the real-world risk of NFC skimming - when someone secretly uses a scanner to collect data from your contactless card or device. In Phish Phingers, that threat becomes a game mechanic. Players take on the roles of taggers (the “phishers”) or targets (the “phished”), using NFC technology to “tag” others in a fast-paced game of digital cat-and-mouse. While playful, the experience is designed to mirror the subtlety and unpredictability of real-world NFC threats.

## Audience and Context
Our audience includes young adults, students, and anyone unfamiliar with the invisible risks of contactless technology. By framing cyber threats in a game format, we aim to make people more curious and informed about everyday digital vulnerabilities - without scaring them off. This prototype was created as part of a university group project with a focus on blending physical computing, interaction design and cybersecurity education.

## How to Run / Interact with the Prototype
### Install the App:
Open the APK via Android Studio or install the app directly onto an NFC-capable Android device.
### Launch the Game Interface:
Once the app is launched, you'll be guided through a simple setup screen where you choose player roles (tagger or target).
### Play the Game:
Taggers are equipped with NFC readers, and targets wear or carry NFC tags. A successful "tag" (scan) registers on the app, which keeps score and gives real-time updates on who’s been “phished”.

## Review Results:
At the end of the round, players can review who tagged who and reflect on how sneaky real-world NFC skimming can be.

Note: While the app supports the game setup and scoring, the actual gameplay happens mostly off-screen, driven by physical interaction and NFC technology.

## Tools and Technologies Used
### Languages
Android Studio – for building and deploying the mobile prototype
Kotlin – main language used for app development
XML – for UI layout and interface design

### Technologies
Host Card Emulation - Used to receive APDU commands
Near Field Communication Reading - Used to converse with HCE device and delivering APDU commands
